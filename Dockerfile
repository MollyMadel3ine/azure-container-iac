# Multi-stage build.
#
# Stage 1 ("builder") installs dependencies — including any that need
# compilers — into an isolated location.
# Stage 2 (runtime) copies ONLY the installed packages and the app
# code onto a slim base: no pip cache, no build tools, smaller and
# safer image.

# Copy requirements alone first: Docker caches layers, so as long as
# requirements.txt is unchanged, rebuilds skip the pip install entirely.
